=====================================================

There are two ways a state can legalize cannabis:

1) A vote the state legislature passes a legalization bill, and
   is signed by the governor.  (All 50 states have this option.)

2) A ballot initiative; where voters vote directly on the issue.
   Ballot initiatives are legal in some states, but not in others.

Since 2019, seven states have legalized cannabis via their state legislatures and governor.

2019 - Illinois
2020 - Vermont
2021 - New York State
2021 - Virginia
2022 - Rhode Island
2023 - Delaware
2024 - Minnesota

Below are the vote totals broken down by Democrats and Republicans for all 7 states that have legalized cannabis since 2019, via state legislatures and governor.

I added up all votes for all 7 states to obtain the total number of Republicans and Democrats who voted FOR and AGAINST cannabis legalization.  Here are the results.

===============================================

3%  of Republicans voted FOR cannabis legalization (7 of 218).
96% of Republicans voted AGAINST cannabis legalization (210 of 218).

95% of Democrats voted FOR cannabis legalization (427 of 453).
5% of Democrats voted AGAINST cannabis legalization (23 of 453).


FINAL GRADE ON CANNABIS LEGALIZATION:

Democratic Party: A+ (95% support)
Republican Party: F- (3% support)

Prohibiting personal lifestyle choices of adults is known as: Nanny-State Government

Here are some bumper sticker ideas I have...

FOR REPUBLICANS:  KEEP MARIJUANA ILLEGAL! - VOTE REPUBLICAN
                  😀😀😀

FOR DEMOCRATS:    END THE NANNY STATE! - DEFEAT REPUBLICANS
                  😀😀😀
