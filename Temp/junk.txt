INTERSTELLAR OBJECT DEFINITION
==============================
An interstellar object is an object that (unlike planets, comets, and asteroids) is NOT gravitationally bound to the Sun, or any other star.  It's an object that originated from outside our solar system, and will likely never return to our solar system.  This can be determined based on the object's speed and trajectory.


OUMUAMUA  (Oh-MuaMua)
=====================
The first interstellar object ever observed in our solar system occurred in October 2017.  It was given the name Oumuamua.  This object attracted immense interest and controversy among astronomers.  Though this object has departed the solar system, a debate over its origin has persisted.

Dr. Avi Loeb, the head of Harvard’s Astronomy department, published a book about Oumuamua titled:

"Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth"

Notice he said...  "THE FIRST SIGN of intelligent life."  Which implies that he rejects all previous claims of alien craft being observed.

Here are the reasons why even astronmers believed this COULD BE an alien artifact.

1)
Oumuamua is the first, and only, interstellar object ever observed by humans.

2)
Oumuamua was estimated to be up to 400 meters long and highly elongated—possibly 10 times longer than it is wide, giving it the shape of a cigar.  Most natural objects are at most three times longer than they are wide.  Its variations in brightness (by a factor of 10) has also never been observed by any other space object that's not a star.

3)
Although its trajectory and acceleration initially suggested it might be a comet, observations revealed no signs of a comet tail, which is the cloud of gas and dust that forms when comets approach the Sun.  This was perplexing, as its motion suggested it was being pushed by something other than gravity alone.

4)
As Oumuamua departed the inner solar system, it accelerated in a way that couldn't be explained by gravity.  Normally, such acceleration in comets is due jets of gas emitted from ice that is sublimating from a gas into a solid.  But no such activity was detected.  This led some astronomers to suggest that it could be propelled by solar radiation pressure, also known as solar winds.  But that would require an object with a large surface area relative to its mass, so it would behave like a sail that catches solar winds.  Oumuamua doesn't fit that criteria.


MYSTERY SOLVED
==============
A pair of scientists have presented a robust natural explanation that accounts for Oumuamua’s strangest behaviors, including its puzzling increase in speed as it hurtled through the solar system.  The new research suggests that the object’s many years in interstellar space left it with an abundance of molecular hydrogen, which was transformed into a gas in the presence of the Sun.

1)
Oumuamua entered the solar system on a hyperbolic trajectory—exactly the type expected for a non-active interstellar object.  Its path and speed matched predictions for objects ejected from other star systems, not those maneuvering under intelligent control.

2)
Its colors are consistent with known types of natural bodies, such as D-type asteroids, comets, and even Pluto.  There is no evidence of artificial materials or unusual reflectivity that would suggest an engineered surface.

3)
The dramatic variation in brightness (by a factor of up to 10) suggests an elongated or possibly disc-like shape, but such brightness variations, while rare, are not unprecedented among small solar system bodies.  Its tumbling motion is also typical for natural objects, especially those that have experienced outgassing or collisions.

4)
While Oumuamua's speed accelerated in a way that couldn't be explained by gravity alone, similar non-gravitational accelerations are observed in comets due to outgassing.  Recent studies suggest the acceleration could be due to the release of entrapped gases (such as molecular hydrogen) from an icy body, which is consistent with a natural cometary origin.

5)
There were no radio signals, no evidence of propulsion, and no features that would indicate artificial origin or technology. Its behavior and properties can all be explained within the context of natural astrophysical processes.

6)
Simulations and theoretical models show that objects like ʻOumuamua could form naturally through processes such as tidal fragmentation of volatile-rich bodies, ejection from planetary systems, or as remnants of disrupted exoplanets.

SUMMARY
=======
In summary, while Oumuamua is highly unusual—especially in its shape and behavior—all observed properties can be explained by known natural processes, and there is no compelling evidence to support the hypothesis of an artificial or alien origin.
